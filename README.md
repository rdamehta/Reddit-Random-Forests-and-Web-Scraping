# Reddit, Random Forests, and Vader

### Description

As a habitual reddit user for better or worse. I decided try and scrape reddit using BS4 and the reddit python api PRAW to see if I could build a classifier to predict the number of comments (interaction) a post has.

The beginning of the notebook describes my methods of gathering Data. The middle is feature engineering, bag of words with post titles, and sentiment analysis with a nifty tool called VaderSentimentAnalyzer, and the final part is comparing a Random Forest and Naive Bayes classifier model.
